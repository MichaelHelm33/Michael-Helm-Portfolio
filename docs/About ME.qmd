## About Me

Hi, I'm Michael Helm, a Statistics and Data Science major at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Originally from Temecula, California, I’m passionate about the power of data-driven decision-making and the meaningful insights that data can uncover. What excites me most is using data to reveal trends and patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed—insights that can drive better strategies and impactful decisions.

### Why Sports Analytics?

As a lifelong sports enthusiast—whether it’s football, baseball, or basketball—pursuing a career in sports analytics feels like a natural choice. I’m excited by the opportunity to bring my passion for sports into my professional life, using data analytics to uncover insights that can shape the game. I believe data is essential for learning and improving; it allows teams and players to analyze performance, refine strategies, and make decisions that lead to success on and off the field. Being part of this process is both inspiring and motivating for me as I work toward a career in sports analytics.

### Core Values

I believe in the importance of preparation and logical thinking, values that guide both my studies and my work. Being prepared allows me to approach projects efficiently, avoiding procrastination and ensuring high-quality results. My logical approach to problem-solving aligns seamlessly with data science, where uncovering data-driven insights often requires a disciplined and methodical mindset.

### Skills and Experience

#### Programming Languages

-   **Python**: Skilled in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning. I’ve used Python in projects to clean data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build predictive models that translate raw data into actionable insights.

-   **R**: Proficient in statistical analysis and visualization, especially within R Studio, which I’ve used for academic projects requiring data exploration.

#### Data Visualization and Analytics Tools

-   **Power BI**: During my internship, I developed Power BI dashboards that provided branch locations with data-driven guidance for business opportunities.

-   **SQL**: Experienced in data manipulation and querying. I utilized SQL extensively in my internship to clean, transform, and prepare large datasets for analysis, ensuring accurate and meaningful visualizations.

#### Cloud and Data Platforms

-   **Snowflake**: Familiar with data management and querying on Snowflake, particularly for handling large datasets efficiently and performing complex analyses.

-   **Azure DevOps**: Skilled in collaborative workflows and code management using Azure DevOps, ensuring seamless project coordination in team environments.

#### Version Control and Collaboration

-   **GitHub**: Proficient in version control and collaborative coding through GitHub, allowing me to maintain organized, reproducible code and work effectively with team members on shared projects.

### Proudest Accomplishment

One of my proudest accomplishments is a machine learning project I completed using NFL Combine data. This project involved analyzing player performance metrics like 40-yard dash times and vertical jumps to predict the player’s position group. As a former football player and lifelong fan, it was incredibly rewarding to apply my data skills to a sport I love, building models that have real relevance to the game.

### Future Goals

In the future, I aspire to work in sports analytics within a professional sports organization or a sports betting company like DraftKings. My goal is to provide game-changing insights to coaches and decision-makers, helping them make strategic choices backed by data. I’m driven by the potential to impact the sports world and bring a new level of data-driven precision to the field.

### Where I See Myself in 5 Years

In five years, I see myself in a secure, impactful role in data analytics, helping to shape the future of sports analytics. I believe the field will continue evolving, with predictive modeling becoming even more sophisticated and influential in decision-making processes. I’m excited to be part of this evolution and to contribute to new advancements in data-driven sports strategies.

### Hobbies and Interests

Outside of data science, I enjoy playing pickup basketball, working out, competing in fantasy football leagues, and exploring new video games. Football is my favorite sport, and I’m inspired by how analytics are increasingly used to make strategic decisions, from choosing plays to evaluating fourth-down scenarios. It’s exciting to see data play a larger role in shaping the game.

### A Message to Potential Connections

I want potential connections to know that I’m not only passionate and hardworking but also a strong team player with excellent communication skills. I’m always eager to learn, adapt, and contribute to any team I’m part of.
